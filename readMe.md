Technologies Used

    Next.js: ShareVision is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. Next.js provides a solid foundation for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

    TypeScript: TypeScript is used throughout the project to add static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality, and developer productivity.

    Fabric.js: Fabric.js is a powerful JavaScript library for working with HTML5 canvas elements. It provides a robust set of features for manipulating graphical objects, making it well-suited for implementing drawing and design functionalities in ShareVision.

    LiveBlock Library: The LiveBlock library is utilized to implement real-time collaboration capabilities in ShareVision, enabling synchronized editing and communication among users.
